The discovery of other solar system wanderers rivaling Pluto in
size suddenly had scientists asking what wasnâ€™t a planet. They
put their heads together in 2006 and came up with three
conditions for planethood: A planet must orbit the sun, be large
enough so that its own gravity molds it into a spherical shape,
and it must have an orbit free of other small objects.
Unfortunately for Pluto, our one time ninth planet failed to
meet the third condition.
