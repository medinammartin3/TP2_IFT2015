This article is about the astronomical object. For other uses,
see Planet (disambiguation). A planet is a large, rounded
astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The
best available theory of planet formation is the nebular
hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses
out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a
protoplanetary disk. Planets grow in this disk by the gradual
accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called
accretion.
